# AI-Powered Personal Assistant Ecosystem

Welcome to the AI-Powered Personal Assistant Ecosystem repository! This project is designed to create a seamless and integrated assistant that leverages edge computing and centralized cloud services to provide an efficient and responsive user experience across multiple platforms.

## Overview

This project utilizes Intel NUC and Jetson Nano devices for edge computing to handle low-latency tasks and local data processing. The web application is hosted on AWS, where more compute-intensive tasks and advanced analytics are performed. This hybrid architecture ensures quick responses and robust data processing, making the assistant both powerful and practical.

## Features

- **Edge Computing with Intel NUC and Jetson Nano:**
  - Local data processing and initial AI inferencing.
  - Voice recognition and immediate user interactions.
  - Smart home control using Home Assistant.
  - Data collection and preprocessing.

- **Centralized Server on AWS:**
  - Advanced analytics and data aggregation.
  - Training and deployment of deep learning models.
  - API Gateway for seamless communication between edge devices and the cloud.
  - Secure and scalable infrastructure for compute-heavy tasks.

- **Cross-Platform Integration:**
  - iPad application for local interactions and controls.
  - Web application for comprehensive management and insights.
  - Real-time data synchronization between edge devices and the cloud.

## Technologies

- **Edge Devices:**
  - **Intel NUC:** Ubuntu, Python, TensorFlow Lite, Home Assistant.
  - **Jetson Nano:** Ubuntu, Python, TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV.

- **Cloud Services (AWS):**
